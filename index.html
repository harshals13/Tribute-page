              <li>2015:At the UFC's "Go Big" press conference, on 4 September 2015, McGregor referenced both Aldo and his other opponent's tendency to pull-out of bouts with him, suggesting that at UFC 194, Aldo would not fight.</li><br>
              <li>2016:I’m here to stay.” It was on 12 January 2016, that the UFC officially announced that Conor McGregor would face Rafael dos Anjos for the UFC Lightweight Championship on 5 March at UFC 196 (then known as UFC 197).</li><br>
              <li>2016:On 23 February, it was announced that dos Anjos was withdrawing from the fight after breaking his foot.Initially assumed to be a lightweight contest, McGregor allowed the bout to be contested at 170-pounds, in the welterweight division,
                to avoid forcing Diaz to cut down to the 155-pound lightweight limit in such little time, telling Diaz to "get comfortable".<br> In an effort to avoid the assault, McGregor gave up his back, allowing Diaz to punch his head into the crook
                of his arm, and secure a rear naked choke. McGregor tapped to the submission at 4:12 into the second round, forcing referee Herb Dean to intervene and stop the bout.<br> The loss was Conor McGregor's first in the UFC, and his third overall.

                UFC Lightweight Championship.</li><br>
              <li>After winning the lightweight championship at UFC 205, McGregor announced he would take time off from the UFC to wait for the birth of his first child due in 2017.</li><br>
